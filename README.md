============

TimelineJS v3: A Storytelling Timeline built in JavaScript.  http://timeline3.knightlab.com

TimelineJS v3 is a rewrite of the popular [TimelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com). It is currently under development and testing. Our goals are to improve the architecture and make it easier to adapt and extend the code and integrate it with other javascript.

For now, see the [hands-on](http://timeline3.knightlab.com/hands-on.html) document for more about putting this code on your site.
