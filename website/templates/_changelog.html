        <h2>Help us out!</h2>
        <p>TimelineJS 3 is a public alpha, which means there are still some rough patches that need to be smoothed over. We need your help in discovering the issues that need to be addressed. <a href="#test-drive">Make a few timelines</a>, and <a href="mailto:support@knightlab.zendesk.com?subject=TimelineJS3%20Feedback">let us know</a> if anything goes wrong.</p>
        <h2>What's new?</h2>
        <p>A little bit here about what's new in TimelineJS 3. Maybe also some info about anything that you can no longer do? (Eras?)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bullet points are nice</li>
            <li>Just to highlight a few things</li>
            <li>Will there be a changelog?</li>
