    <div class="small-7 columns">
      <p>TimelineJS is released under the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License (MPL), version 2.0</a>. That means that TimelineJS is free to "use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute" or otherwise employ. You don't need our permission to publish stories with TimelineJS and you don't need to pay us any fees or arrange any further license beyond the MPL. Essentially, there is only one restriction: you cannot take our source code and resell it in either its original form or in a modified form. However, this is not legal counsel and you may wish to consult your own lawyers.</p>
