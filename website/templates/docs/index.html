      <h1>Using the new TimelineJS</h1>
      <p>TimelineJS is an open-source tool that enables anyone to build visually rich, interactive timelines. Beginners can <a href="#spreadsheet-walkthrough">create a timeline using nothing more than a Google spreadsheet</a>. Experts can use their JSON skills to <a href="json-format.html">create custom installations</a> while keeping TimelineJS's core functionality.</p>
      <h2>Embed media in your timeline</h2>
      <p>TimelineJS can pull in media from a variety of sources and has built-in support for Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, Google Maps, DropBox, DocumentCloud, Wikipedia, SoundCloud, Storify, iframes, major video sites (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) and more. <a href="media-types.html">Read more about the media types TimelineJS works with.</a></p>

        <h4>Tips & tricks</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Keep it short. We recommend not having more than 20 slides for a reader to click through.</li>
          <li>Pick stories that have a strong chronological narrative. It does not work well for stories that need to jump around in the timeline.</li>
          <li>Write each event as a part of a larger narrative.</li>
          <li>Include events that build up to major occurrences â€” not just the major events.</li>
        </ol>
